					<h4>Montgomery County,  Maryland United States</h4>

				<p>Low-income communities have been disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. Thus, we believe we could make an impact by distributing masks at local free clinics and food banks in the Baltimore - Washington Metropolitan Area. </p>

					<h3>Aid for Yemen</h3>
					<h4>July 20th, 2020 - August 11th, 2020</h4>
				</header>
				<p> Yemen is currently experiencing the largest humanitarian crisis in the world. Caught in the middle of war, famine, and now a pandemic, many of the Yemeni people are in need of support. We are holding a fundraiser that will donate proceeds to Unicef and the United Nations High Commissionerr for Refugees (UNHCR), as we have researched and worked with officials from these organizations to ensure that our donations will go to assisting in providing for the medical needs for the people of Yemen. </p>

					<h3>Masks & First Aid Kits for Black Lives Matter Protests</h3>
					<h4>June 3rd, 2020 - June 10th, 2020</h4>
					<h4>Washington, D.C., United States</h4>
				</header>
				<p> As a result of the death of George Floyd as well as many past incidents of police brutality, many across the nation took to the streets to protest. Unfortunately, this is all happened amidst a global pandemic, as there was no vaccine or cure for SARS-CoV-2. To help out, helped distribute masks to anyone attending the protests.</p>

				<p>In partnership with Global Links, we were able to ship over 500lbs of surplus medical supplies to Maho Regional Hospital. We mediated between hospital administrators in Maho and Global Links to make sure we were sending supplies that were needed. Some examples of materials shipped include, wheelchairs, crutches, and surgical kits.</p>

				</header>
				<p> This was the first project we undertook after noticing the shortage of supplies in this rural hospital. It was challenging for staff to care for the amount of patients being admitted. We donated multiple nebulizers to help out.</p>
