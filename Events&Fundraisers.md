					<h3>Center of Hope & Horowpathana School</h3>
					<h4>July 20th, 2020 - Present</h4>
					<h4>Sri Lanka</h4>
				</header>
				<p>The Center of Hope was started in 1979 in Mattakkuliya as a response to the Sri Lankan government's forcible relocation of hundreds of families to "clean up the city of Colombo" in 1976. This relocation led to the creation of the Summitpura slum, and the Center of Hope aims to support this community by providing children ages 3-16 with resources for education and physical, emotional, and spiritual health.  </p>
				<p>We are also sending out medical supplies and hygiene kits to the Horowpathana School, a rural school in Kebithigollewa, Sri Lanka with 110 children. Being in a rural area, they lack many resources including basic health and hygiene supplies and are sometimes supported by the teachers themselves. The region was severely affected by the Sri Lankan Civil War, which lasted for around 30 years. All donations will go into purchasing and shipping first aid kits for the schools and supplies for hygiene kits (including masks, toothbrushes, toothpaste, soap, hand sanitizer, water bottles, and lunch boxes) for 405 children in total.  </p>

					<h3>Masks for Free Clinics and Food Banks </h3>
					<h4>June 4th, 2020 - Present</h4>
					<h4>Montgomery County,  Maryland United States</h4>
				</header>
				<p>Low-income communities have been disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. Thus, we believe we could make an impact by distributing masks at local free clinics and food banks in the Baltimore - Washington Metropolitan Area. </p>
