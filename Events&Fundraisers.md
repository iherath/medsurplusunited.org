				<p>The ongoing COVID-19 crisis is overwhelming intensive care units (ICUs) in hospitals across Sri Lanka. In response, MedSurplus United is cooperating with a network of Sri Lankan communities across the United States to supply hospitals across Sri Lanka with necessary supplies to care for COVID-19 patients. These supplies include patient monitors, O2 concentrators, high flow nasal units, and other respiratory-related supplies. Click below to support our efforts, and be sure to select "MedSurplus United - 501(c)3 charity" in the "Referred by" field.</p>
