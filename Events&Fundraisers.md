				<p>The ongoing COVID-19 crisis is overwhelming intensive care units (ICUs) in hospitals across Sri Lanka. In response, MedSurplus United is cooperating with a network of Sri Lankan communities across the United States to supply hospitals across Sri Lanka with necessary supplies to care for COVID-19 patients. These supplies include personal protective equipment (PPE), patient monitors, O2 concentrators, high flow nasal units, and other respiratory-related supplies.</p>
